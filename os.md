**Operating Systems (OS) Basics**

**Definition:**
An OS is software that manages hardware and software resources on a computer. It provides a user interface and manages tasks.

**Functions of an Operating System**
**Process Management:**

**Creation and Termination**: Initiates and ends processes.
**Scheduling:** Determines the order in which processes run (e.g., Round Robin, FIFO).
**Synchronization:** Manages concurrent processes to prevent conflicts.

**Memory Management:**

**Allocation and Deallocation:** Distributes memory to processes and frees it when no longer needed.
**Paging and Segmentation:** Techniques to manage memory effectively and enable virtual memory.
**Memory Protection:** Prevents processes from accessing each other’s memory space.

**File System Management:**

*File Operations:* Supports creation, deletion, reading, and writing files.
*Directory Structure:* Organizes files in a hierarchical structure for easy navigation.
*Access Control:* Manages permissions and user access to files.

**Device Management:**

*Device Drivers:* Interfaces with hardware devices, translating OS commands into device-specific operations.
*I/O Management:* Handles input and output operations between the computer and external devices.

**Security and Access Control:**

*User Authentication:* Verifies user identity (e.g., passwords, biometrics).
*Data Encryption:* Protects sensitive data from unauthorized access.
*Firewall and Antivirus Integration:* Enhances system security against threats.


**Types of Operating Systems**

*Batch Operating Systems:*

Executes jobs in batches without user interaction. Early systems used punch cards for input.

*Time-Sharing Operating Systems:*

Allows multiple users to access the computer simultaneously. Processes share CPU time, giving the illusion of parallelism.

*Distributed Operating Systems:*

Manages a group of independent computers and makes them appear as a single system to users. Enhances resource sharing and fault tolerance.

*Embedded Operating Systems:*

Designed for specific control applications (e.g., automotive systems, appliances). Typically has limited resources and is optimized for performance.

*Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS):*

Provides immediate processing and response to inputs. Used in systems where timing is critical (e.g., medical devices, industrial control systems).


**Popular Operating Systems**

*Windows:*

Developed by Microsoft. Widely used in personal and business environments. Known for its graphical user interface (GUI) and extensive software compatibility.

*macOS:*

Developed by Apple for Mac computers. Known for its sleek design, security features, and integration with Apple hardware.

*Linux:*

Open-source and highly customizable. Popular for servers, programming, and embedded systems. Variants include Ubuntu, Fedora, and CentOS.

*Android:*

A mobile operating system based on Linux, developed by Google. Used in smartphones and tablets, known for its vast app ecosystem.

*iOS:*

Developed by Apple for iPhone and iPad. Known for its user-friendly interface and robust security features.

*Unix*:

A powerful, multiuser OS used mainly in servers and workstations. It has various derivatives, including Linux and macOS.

**Key Concepts in Operating Systems**

**Kernel:**

*Definition:*

The kernel is the core component of an operating system. It manages system resources and facilitates communication between hardware and software.\

*Types:*

**Monolithic Kernels:**

*Definition:* A monolithic kernel is a single large program that includes all the necessary services and functions to manage the system, including process management, memory management, device drivers, and system calls.

*Features:*

Single Address Space: All kernel services run in the same memory space, which allows for fast communication between them.

Performance: Generally faster due to less overhead in context switching between services.

Complexity: Can be more complex and challenging to maintain because all components are tightly coupled.

*Examples:*

Linux: The Linux kernel is a prime example of a monolithic kernel. It includes device drivers and file system management in the kernel space.

**Microkernels:**

Definition: A microkernel is a minimalistic approach to kernel design. It includes only the most essential services, such as basic process and memory management, and delegates other services (like device drivers and file systems) to user space.

*Features:*

*Modularity:*

Components are separated, making the system easier to maintain and extend. Services can be added or updated without affecting the core kernel.

*Stability and Security:*

If a user space service crashes, it doesn’t bring down the entire system, enhancing stability.

*Performance Overhead:*

Can incur more overhead due to communication between user space and kernel space.

**Examples:**

*Minix:*
An educational microkernel system that demonstrates microkernel concepts.

*QNX:*
A commercial real-time operating system known for its microkernel architecture, widely used in embedded systems.

**Shell:**

*Definition:*

The shell is the interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.

*Types:*

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**

Users type commands (e.g., Bash in Linux).

**Graphical User Interface (GUI):** 

Visual interface with icons and windows (e.g., Windows Explorer).

**Multitasking:**

**Definition:** 

The ability of an operating system to manage multiple processes simultaneously.

**Types:**

*Preemptive Multitasking:*
The OS allocates CPU time and can interrupt processes (e.g., modern Windows and Linux).

Cooperative Multitasking: Processes voluntarily yield control to allow others to run (e.g., older versions of Mac OS).
Virtual Memory:

Definition: An abstraction that allows the OS to use disk space as an extension of RAM, enabling larger applications to run than physical memory alone can support.
Paging: Divides memory into fixed-size pages; allows non-contiguous memory allocation.
Swapping: Moves inactive pages to disk, freeing up RAM for active processes.
File System:

Definition: The method and data structure that the OS uses to manage files on storage devices.
Types:
FAT (File Allocation Table): Simple file system used in older systems and USB drives.
NTFS (New Technology File System): Advanced file system used by Windows, supporting large files and security features.
ext4: A popular file system for Linux, offering journaling and improved performance.
System Calls:

Definition: Interfaces through which programs request services from the OS. They provide a way for user-level applications to interact with the kernel.
Examples:
File Operations: Open, read, write, close.
Process Control: Create, terminate, wait for processes.
Memory Management: Allocate and deallocate memory.
Device Drivers:

Definition: Specialized software that allows the OS to communicate with hardware devices. Each device requires a specific driver to function properly.
Function: Translates OS commands into device-specific operations, ensuring compatibility.
Concurrency:

Definition: The ability of the OS to execute multiple processes or threads simultaneously.
Synchronization: Techniques (like semaphores and mutexes) used to manage access to shared resources and prevent data corruption.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):

Definition: Mechanisms that allow processes to communicate and synchronize with each other.
Methods:
Pipes: Data flows in one direction between processes.
Message Queues: Processes send and receive messages to/from a queue.
Shared Memory: Processes access the same memory space for fast communication.
