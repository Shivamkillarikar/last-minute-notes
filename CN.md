The **OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) reference model** is a conceptual framework that standardizes the functions of a communication system into seven distinct layers. Each layer in the OSI model is responsible for specific tasks and interacts with the layers directly above and below it. The model helps in understanding and designing communication protocols in network architecture.

## The 7 Layers of the OSI Model:

### Layer 2: Data Link Layer
   - Function: Provides node-to-node data transfer and error correction in frames. It ensures reliable transmission over the physical layer.
   - Sub-layers: Logical Link Control (LLC) and Media Access Control (MAC).
   - Examples: Ethernet (MAC addresses), Wi-Fi (802.11).
   - Role: Error detection, frame synchronization, and flow control.

### Layer 3: Network Layer
   - Function: Determines the best path for data transmission and handles addressing, routing, and packet forwarding between devices.
   - Examples: IP (Internet Protocol), routers.
   - Role: Manages logical addressing (IP addresses), path determination, and traffic control.

### Layer 7: Application Layer
   - Function: Provides network services directly to end-user applications. This layer is closest to the user and interacts with software applications.
   - Examples: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, DNS.
   - Role: Facilitates communication between software applications and the network, providing user interface and data handling.

### Physical Layer:

## Function of the Physical Layer
The Physical Layer is responsible for the transmission of raw bits (0s and 1s) over a physical medium between devices.

It defines the hardware specifications like cables, connectors, and network interfaces.

## Transmission Modes
Simplex: Communication in one direction only (e.g., TV broadcast).

Half-Duplex: Communication in both directions, but only one direction at a time (e.g., walkie-talkies).

Full-Duplex: Simultaneous two-way communication (e.g., telephone).

## Transmission Mediums

### DATA LINK LAYER

## Function of the Data Link Layer
The Data Link Layer provides reliable node-to-node communication and error detection over the physical layer. It also manages how data is packaged into frames and how it is transmitted between network devices.
It transforms the raw transmission facility provided by the physical layer into a reliable link.

## Data Link Sublayers
The Data Link Layer is divided into two sublayers:
Logical Link Control (LLC): Responsible for flow control, error control, and managing data exchange between network devices.
Media Access Control (MAC): Controls how devices on the network gain access to the data and permission to transmit it. It manages physical addressing and access control.

## Error Detection and Correction Methods

Even Parity: Adds a parity bit so that the total number of 1-bits is even.
Odd Parity: Adds a parity bit so that the total number of 1-bits is odd.
Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC): A more robust method for detecting errors by generating a checksum based on data bits.
Hamming Code: Error correction code that can detect and correct single-bit errors.

## Media Access Control (MAC) Address:
MAC Addresses are unique 48-bits hardware number of a computer, which is embedded into network card (known as Network Interface Card) during the time of manufacturing. MAC is a type og physical address which is used to communicate or transfer the data from one computer to another computer

## Access Control Mechanisms
CSMA/CD (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection):
Used in Ethernet networks to detect collisions. Devices listen for the carrier signal to determine if the medium is free before transmitting.
CSMA/CA (Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance):
Used in wireless networks (Wi-Fi). Devices check for a free channel before sending data to avoid collisions.
Token Passing: Devices pass a "token" around the network. A device can only send data when it has the token, ensuring there are no collisions (used in Token Ring networks).

## Data Link Layer Protocols
Ethernet: A widely used protocol in wired LANs (Local Area Networks) defined by IEEE 802.3.

Sliding Window Protocol: The sender can send multiple frames before receiving an acknowledgment, improving efficiency.


## Network Devices at the Data Link Layer
Switches: Operate at the data link layer and use MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination. They help reduce network collisions by dividing a network into segments.
Bridges: Used to connect two network segments, filtering and forwarding data based on MAC addresses.

## Error Detection and Correction:
   - **Checksums**: Used to detect errors in transmitted data.
   - **TCP Retransmission**: If a segment is lost or corrupted, it will be retransmitted.

## Connection Establishment in TCP:
   - **Three-Way Handshake**: 
     - SYN (synchronize) is sent by the client.
     - SYN-ACK is sent by the server.
     - ACK is sent by the client to establish a connection.

## Connection Termination in TCP:
   - **Four-Way Handshake**:
     - FIN: Sent by the sender to terminate the connection.
     - ACK: Acknowledgment from the receiver.

These are the main points that are commonly covered in MCQs for the Transport Layer.

### SESSION LAYER

## Primary Functions of the Session Layer:
Session Establishment, Maintenance, and Termination:
The session layer is responsible for establishing, managing, and terminating sessions (connections) between two communicating devices or applications.

*Synchronization*:
Introduces checkpoints (sync points) during data transmission, so that in case of a failure, the session can resume from the last successful sync point rather than restarting from the beginning.

*Dialog Control*:
Manages the flow of communication between two devices.
Can operate in three modes: Simplex, Half-Duplex, and Full-Duplex.

*Session Recovery*:
Restores a session if it crashes or is interrupted, ensuring that communication can resume seamlessly.

## Session Layer Protocols:

*NetBIOS (Network Basic Input/Output System)*:
Provides services related to session establishment and communication in a network.

*RPC (Remote Procedure Call)*:
Allows a program to execute code on another machine as if it were a local function call.

Used for establishing VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) by encapsulating and securing data over the internet.

*SMPP (Short Message Peer-to-Peer)*:
Protocol used for exchanging SMS messages between short message service centers (SMSCs).

## Dialog Control Modes:

*Simplex*: Communication is unidirectional, only one device can send data (e.g., keyboard to computer).
*Half-Duplex*: Communication is bidirectional, but only one device can send data at a time (e.g., walkie-talkies).
*Full-Duplex*: Communication is bidirectional, allowing both devices to send and receive data simultaneously (e.g., telephone communication).

## Synchronization and Checkpoints:

*Checkpoints*: The session layer can insert checkpoints in the data stream to ensure that long communications can resume from a specific point if the session is interrupted.
For example, in large file transfers, checkpoints can allow resuming the transfer from the last checkpoint rather than starting over.

## Session Layer in Connection Types:
The session layer provides coordination for two-way communication by managing which side should be transmitting at any point, making it crucial for dialog control and session management.

## Session Restoration:
In case of a connection failure, the session layer ensures that the session can be resumed from the point of failure, without needing to re-establish a new session.

## Distinction from Transport Layer:
While the Transport Layer is concerned with reliable delivery of data, the Session Layer focuses on managing and controlling the dialog between devices, including when and how long a system should send or receive data.

## Session Layer in OSI vs. TCP/IP:
In the TCP/IP model, the functions of the session layer are typically handled by the application layer and transport layer, and are not distinctly separated as in the OSI model.

## Session Layer Services:
*Authentication*: Ensures that the user or device has the permission to access certain services.
*Authorization*: Grants permissions based on the identity authenticated in the session.

## Examples of Applications Using the Session Layer:
*Video conferencing applications*: Requires session establishment, dialog control, and session termination.
*Streaming services*: Handle session control to manage how the video/audio stream is started, paused, and resumed.
